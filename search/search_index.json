I wish I had something similar when I was very new to R.

You managed to have us build a connection as a   group, even though it is harder over zoom!   The size of the group also helped with that I suppose.   Also, I liked to mostly have the teaching in the morning   and working on our own in the afternoon.   I think the feedback sessions went really well and   I was surprised that I could give (hopefully)   useful feedback to class mates even though I did   not necessarily understand their research very well.   That proved to me that you did a really good job teaching us   the skill of critically assessing   visuals! :)</li> <li>We have time to explore the software and make graphical   abstract and figures for our own project.</li> <li>The type of exercises, the pace of the course + the constant feedback   led to acquiring an actual skill, that we can use for our projects.   Illustrating can be chaotic in the beginning,   especially with specific ,   so this course helped having a clear view on where to begin.   Also, this course provided enough material for future need,   in case we need help on this topic.</li> <li>This was the best full online course I have had.   The amount of interaction was great,   so please keep these discussion/break out sessions in   the course.</li> <li>The teachers were excellent and actively tried to make the content engaging   (even the coding!).   The teachers were very reachable by slack   too. I learnt valuable knowledge in how to apply design principles   to communicate my science. I like how we have each other feedback and we   also got feedback from the teachers too.</li> <li>Very interesting and fun course,   Meike were highly engaged and really offered to help   and provide feedback continuously during the course!</li> <li>Two of the lectures i particularly enjoyed and were excellent.   I also enjoyed the examination format, as it was both useful for our work,   while also being part of the course</li> <li>Everything was great!   This was definitely the best course I have followed at KI!   I liked the balance between lectures and working by ourselves.   The lectures were also fun because they were quite interactive   and the little exercises we did during the lectures   were very helpful to get in the   process.   I got many insights about how to create better visuals and   it was good to get feedback from the teachers and the other students.   Although we are all from very different fields,   it was helpful to understand how others perceive your figures.   These two weeks flew by and although I had to work on quite some other things   beside the course, I really enjoyed every minute I spent on   this course :)</li> <li>All the lectures and practice exercises were very well developed   to improve our skills in scientific illustration and data visualisation.   I really enjoyed to do the assignments because I could use my own data   do develop something I could use later on in my publications or   presentations. It was also fun to know all the logic behind the way our   brain receive and interpret an image, and the ways we could improve   our illustrations for a better communication process.   Also the use of different  and the potential of each one.   I learned a lot and I am   very grateful I have the opportunity to take this course on time   before my first manuscripts submissions.   I was a little bit reluctant about being   100% online course, but the way it was conduced, the interactions,   the management of time for each task made it easier. Congratulations for   all professionals involved on teaching with high quality in the course.</li> <li>I really liked the style of how and when we received feedback   on the hand ins in the course and how much support was given when working   on the assignments.</li> <li>very practical :)</li> <li>Interactive sessions and hands on activities during the session.</li> <li>I really enjoyed the Adobe illustrator activities to practice.   I tried before to learn with youtube videos but it was highly confusing.   Doing the   activities like this help to learn how to use the different tools   in a simple and helpful way.</li> <li>Everything about this course was great!   From the topics to the way it is taught.   I particularly enjoyed the peer-review and team work sessions   where the instructors were also coming to check in and   give input about the task.   This is one of the best online courses I\u2019ve ever attended.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"evaluations/20250404/#17-do-you-have-any-recommendations-as-to-how-the-course-could-be-improved-if-so-please-specify-which-parts-and-how","title":"17. Do you have any recommendations as to how the course could be improved? If so, please specify which parts and how","text":"<ul> <li>Maybe spend more time for Mermaid.   It was a very interesting tool but in just a short time.   I also would recommend to keep the course with students   with different background because I learned a lot from them and   also received valuable feedback for improving my figures   (maybe try to keep spreading the word out of KI).</li> <li>For me the less useful parts were the introduction to R/ggplot2,   because I already had some programming background,   so although I enjoyed the lectures from Martin and Richel,   it would have been nicer for me to have used that time to work   on the poster/figures myself.   Maybe it can be set up more flexible   that you can choose to which lectures to attend.</li> <li>I think it would be nice to have on session in the beginning   of the second week on how to transform your own data into tidy data   with which you are able to work in R/ggplot2.</li> <li>A recommendation is to implement one or two more lectures   with a format similar to Martin Jonnson's,   where we could follow his slides - even later offline - one by one,   to create a graph.   My recommendation is to do something similar with a complicated illustration,   so we can understand even better the process of how to start from   an empty artboard and end up with a high-quality creative illustration.</li> <li>My only critique would be to maybe ask students at the start of the course   their prior coding knowledge. As in the course information it is written   like you need R and illustrator.   But the course is actually completable with python and Inkscape/designer.   If there could be some sort of support possible for students   who prefer python over R that would be great too.</li> <li>It might be nice to introduce ggplot data visualisation earlier in week 1,   so there is a bit more time to learn to work with this program and   already get feedback together   with the graphical abstract at the start of week 2.</li> <li>I would have liked to have some more optional   adobe illustrator activities to do.</li> <li>There was a lot to do during the course which required more working hours   than expected, even though it probably on individual level was up   to the student to decide when the assignments were \"good enough\",   but maybe clarify what is really necessary for the course purpose   in contrast to individual development and individual choices.</li> <li>In general, I really loved to course,   so this is only small details and a personal feeling!</li> </ul> <p>I felt like it was quite a lot of submissions...   but I was also attempting to make a whole poster and   there was not enough time for that...   I think it would have been less stressful to submit maybe   only a rough outline of a poster or graphical abstract   and then focus on one or two illustrations and make those really nice   using all the 3D and shading and colouring tools we learned...   For the feedback I had a hard time understanding the difference between   first and second feedback person and I think it would be fine   to just let the first person say whatever comes to mind   and the second one adding if they have any further comment... - I feel like the use of adobe/ inkscape could have been better explained.   The slides that I used were interactive and were good,   but i had to look at further youtube videos on it as well.   I liked that there was a variety of choice of software   at varying price points, but considering i was just starting,   I used the free choice.   That was perhaps a bit more limiting in my ability to create something,   though I'm not sure as I did not try the others.   The last thing I would say is perhaps to put in some examples   of work that is not so refined and submitted to journals and magazines -   something that might be a bit more achievable for PhD/ post doc work.   Most of what we saw was of such high quality that i was inspired by it,   but had no idea how to achieve that. - more examples of good scientific illustrations of the most common   plots -&gt; a good bar graph, regression analysis, correlation matrix,   heat map, forest plot etc. - Maybe include one session in person for the people that are in Stockholm   or that can attend. It would be great to have the last session be   in person and receive feedback from the others. - I guess the feedback should also be in written format from peers too.   It will help the creator to incorporate and select the best suggestions   from them in the final versions.</p>"},{"location":"evaluations/20251003/","title":"Evaluation","text":"<ul> <li>Lesson plan</li> <li>Evaluation</li> <li>Reflection</li> <li>Session 1: ggplot2 and basic R</li> <li>Date: 2025-10-03</li> <li>pre.csv</li> <li>post.csv</li> <li>analyse.R</li> </ul>"},{"location":"evaluations/20251003/#statistics","title":"Statistics","text":"question mean_pre mean_post p_value different I feel comfortable with the book 'R for Data Science' 0.7692308 4.000000 0.0002311 TRUE I can recommend the swirl package to the right person 0.6153846 3.222222 0.0018848 TRUE I can use ggplot2 to create a simple plot 1.8461538 3.666667 0.0635871 FALSE I can save a plot created by ggplot2 2.0000000 3.555556 0.0759172 FALSE I can tell what ggplot2 aesthetics are 1.0000000 3.666667 0.0010547 TRUE I can tell what ggplot2 geometrical objects are 0.6923077 3.666667 0.0011247 TRUE I can assign a value to a variable 1.6153846 4.000000 0.0043364 TRUE I can use snake case when naming a variable 0.5384615 3.888889 0.0001414 TRUE I can write a comment 1.9230769 3.666667 0.0520753 FALSE I can correct typos in simple code 1.9230769 3.777778 0.0283757 TRUE I can read a comma-separated file 1.9230769 3.875000 0.0457190 TRUE <p>f</p>"},{"location":"evaluations/20251003/#confidence","title":"Confidence","text":""},{"location":"evaluations/20251003/#feedback","title":"Feedback","text":"<ul> <li>This was a little fast-paced, even for a user with some experience with R.

She really helps you to look at design as both artist and scientist.</li> <li>It was great Meike was open to discussing and having exercises   for the three major vector illustration programs.   I valued that flexibility.   Happy to see the design elements and theory in how to build figures.</li> <li>Yes. The most exciting part for me was the projects we had to do.   They were challenging in a way that pushed me to go out my way   to finish the text.   They weren't so easy for me but I loved   that I got to see the level of my growth through them.</li> <li>Excellent course format and lectures by Meike.   It's clear she knows how to structure and convey information well.   The notion page was also very clear, nice to hold onto.   The frequent breaks and active participation really boosted my concentration   spans (during pandemic I was always exhausted after half a day,   here not at all).</li> <li>The content of the lessons was in general really good.

Do you have any recommendations as to how the course could be improved?","text":"<p>If so, please specify which parts and how. Do you have any recommendations as to how the course could be improved? If so, please specify which parts and how</p> <ul> <li>I think the way that the course is structured in the data viz part   is a bit messy, meaning that we were required to start working   on the code but with only few functions explained and   how the language actually works.   This led to some confusion and to rely on other tools   to make the code work.   It could be better to first give more background on how R functions   and then make the students work on the coding.</li> <li>I am not from Karolinska Institute but from a different uni and   I was a bit surprised when I got the schedule the week before the course.   Of course I knew it was a 2-week course   but at least for me it was a lot because   I still had to do my normal lab work next too it.   Some more information already during the application process   would have helped.   The sections on R were not so well organized in my opinion.   It seemed that the two different teachers for R did not talk to each other   so some things were redundant - and some things that were explained   later really should've come first.   Especially regarding R there was a huge range of experiences   within the group and I feel like most people were left out;   either because it was too easy or because it was too complicated.   The talk from Lonni Bresancon while interesting was not relevant   to the learning objectives at all - maybe this could have been skipped   or made more clear that it was not mandatory.</li> <li>I would suggest adjusting the order of the R lectures.   It felt like some of the more advanced material   came before the basics were properly introduced,   which made it a bit hard to follow for some people.   I think starting with the foundational concepts earlier   would make the progression smoother and more accessible for everyone.</li> <li>I didn\u2019t enjoy group work in R. I think that when it comes to coding,   individual work is the way to go. When it\u2019s such diverse group there   is always someone knowing a lot and someone knowing nothing and   it ends up with one person coding and the rest not knowing what to do.   I had similar sessions several times and it always ends like that,   which means that most people learn nothing during it.   But it was just one exercise, so no biggie.</li> <li>Maybe the course could be divided in two:   one for complete beginners, and one for users with some experience.   Beginners could benefit from having more dedicated time to learn   to use the software, and experienced users could focus on more advanced   exercises and tools.</li> <li>I found that the mermaid toolbox was not that useful   and the time allocated to it was not needed.</li> <li>The course is well structured and touches on so many aspects of learning.   However, the one major thing that can be improved is to find a way   to help complete beginners in more active way to avoid   them having the anxiety out not understanding something and   feeling the pressure because others are ahead with the task.   Otherwise, they end up feeling left behind.</li> <li>Sessions regarding the use of R could be more wisely organized.   Now the exercise with Martin was a bit out of place and hard to follow.   Also during Richel's sessions there was quite limited time to work   through the exercises if you had not worked with R before.   Maybe a similar tutorial session with self-study component   that was now done with Illustrator could work better also with R.</li> <li>Martin Jonsson had a accessible presentation about R,   but fluency and structure could be improved   (seemed confused with some examples).   How do we use ggplot in concert with vector software to make a clear figure?</li> <li>I can recommend some clarity in the syllabus,   there is no mention there about R,   however it still was a dominant part of the course.   Based on the syllabus my expectations were a course   predominant on the usage illustration software and   not an introduction to using R and plotting with R.</li> <li>I think the r coding parts were the weakest part of the course.   I luckily had prior knowledge of R, so for me it was good to follow.   However, the coding that was shown was usually very fast   without explaining every step.   I can imagine this is not optimal for new learners.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"evaluations/20251008/","title":"Evaluation","text":"<ul> <li>Lesson plan</li> <li>Evaluation</li> <li>Reflection</li> <li>Session 2: data wrangling</li> <li>Date: 2025-10-08</li> </ul> <p>This lesson was cancelled due to me being ill :-/</p>"},{"location":"introduction_1/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Learning outcomes</p> <ul> <li>Understand the goal of the course</li> <li>Read the learning outcomes of the course</li> </ul> For teachers <p>Teaching goals are:</p> <ul> <li>Learners have heard to goal of the course</li> <li>Learners have filled in the initial confidence form</li> </ul> <p>Prior question:</p> <ul> <li>What is R?</li> <li>What are features of R?</li> <li>What is the Tidyverse?</li> <li>What are features of the Tidyverse?</li> </ul>"},{"location":"introduction_1/#goal-of-this-course","title":"Goal of this course","text":"<p>Feel comfortable to learn R from a Tidyverse-first approach.</p>"},{"location":"introduction_1/#exercises","title":"Exercises","text":""},{"location":"introduction_1/#exercise-1","title":"Exercise 1","text":"<ul> <li>Fill in the initial confidence form <code>TODO: create a new form</code></li> </ul> For teachers: what is in that form? <p>These are the questions to measure your initial confidence in what you are going to learn today.

You managed to have us build a connection as a   group, even though it is harder over zoom!   The size of the group also helped with that I suppose.   Also, I liked to mostly have the teaching in the morning   and working on our own in the afternoon.   I think the feedback sessions went really well and   I was surprised that I could give (hopefully)   useful feedback to class mates even though I did   not necessarily understand their research very well.   That proved to me that you did a really good job teaching us   the skill of critically assessing   visuals! :)</li> <li>We have time to explore the software and make graphical   abstract and figures for our own project.</li> <li>The type of exercises, the pace of the course + the constant feedback   led to acquiring an actual skill, that we can use for our projects.   Illustrating can be chaotic in the beginning,   especially with specific ,   so this course helped having a clear view on where to begin.   Also, this course provided enough material for future need,   in case we need help on this topic.</li> <li>This was the best full online course I have had.   The amount of interaction was great,   so please keep these discussion/break out sessions in   the course.</li> <li>The teachers were excellent and actively tried to make the content engaging   (even the coding!).</li> </ul> <p>Ha, that is me :-)</p> <p>The teachers were very reachable by slack   too. I learnt valuable knowledge in how to apply design principles   to communicate my science. I like how we have each other feedback and we   also got feedback from the teachers too.</p> <ul> <li>Very interesting and fun course,   Meike were highly engaged and really offered to help   and provide feedback continuously during the course!</li> <li>Two of the lectures i particularly enjoyed and were excellent.   I also enjoyed the examination format, as it was both useful for our work,   while also being part of the course</li> <li>Everything was great!   This was definitely the best course I have followed at KI!   I liked the balance between lectures and working by ourselves.   The lectures were also fun because they were quite interactive   and the little exercises we did during the lectures   were very helpful to get in the   process.   I got many insights about how to create better visuals and   it was good to get feedback from the teachers and the other students.   Although we are all from very different fields,   it was helpful to understand how others perceive your figures.   These two weeks flew by and although I had to work on quite some other things   beside the course, I really enjoyed every minute I spent on   this course :)</li> <li>All the lectures and practice exercises were very well developed   to improve our skills in scientific illustration and data visualisation.   I really enjoyed to do the assignments because I could use my own data   do develop something I could use later on in my publications or   presentations. It was also fun to know all the logic behind the way our   brain receive and interpret an image, and the ways we could improve   our illustrations for a better communication process.   Also the use of different  and the potential of each one.   I learned a lot and I am   very grateful I have the opportunity to take this course on time   before my first manuscripts submissions.   I was a little bit reluctant about being   100% online course, but the way it was conduced, the interactions,   the management of time for each task made it easier. Congratulations for   all professionals involved on teaching with high quality in the course.</li> <li>I really liked the style of how and when we received feedback   on the hand ins in the course and how much support was given when working   on the assignments.</li> <li>very practical :)</li> <li>Interactive sessions and hands on activities during the session.</li> <li>I really enjoyed the Adobe illustrator activities to practice.   I tried before to learn with youtube videos but it was highly confusing.   Doing the   activities like this help to learn how to use the different tools   in a simple and helpful way.</li> <li>Everything about this course was great!   From the topics to the way it is taught.   I particularly enjoyed the peer-review and team work sessions   where the instructors were also coming to check in and   give input about the task.

It was a very interesting tool but in just a short time.</li> </ul> <p>Hey, that is me :-)</p> <p>I also would recommend to keep the course with students   with different background because I learned a lot from them and   also received valuable feedback for improving my figures   (maybe try to keep spreading the word out of KI).</p> <ul> <li>For me the less useful parts were the introduction to R/ggplot2,   because I already had some programming background,   so although I enjoyed the lectures from Martin and Richel,   it would have been nicer for me to have used that time to work   on the poster/figures myself.   Maybe it can be set up more flexible   that you can choose to which lectures to attend.</li> </ul> <p>I agree that this can be made optional.</p> <ul> <li>I think it would be nice to have on session in the beginning   of the second week on how to transform your own data into tidy data   with which you are able to work in R/ggplot2.</li> </ul> <p>I can teach that! It is chapters 3 and 5 in the book. I would need an extra two hours for that.</p> <ul> <li>A recommendation is to implement one or two more lectures   with a format similar to Martin Jonnson's,   where we could follow his slides - even later offline - one by one,   to create a graph.   My recommendation is to do something similar with a complicated illustration,   so we can understand even better the process of how to start from   an empty artboard and end up with a high-quality creative illustration.</li> <li>My only critique would be to maybe ask students at the start of the course   their prior coding knowledge. As in the course information it is written   like you need R and illustrator.   But the course is actually completable with python and Inkscape/designer.   If there could be some sort of support possible for students   who prefer python over R that would be great too.</li> <li>It might be nice to introduce ggplot data visualisation earlier in week 1,   so there is a bit more time to learn to work with this program and   already get feedback together   with the graphical abstract at the start of week 2.</li> </ul> <p>I can agree to move this earlier.</p> <ul> <li>I would have liked to have some more optional   adobe illustrator activities to do.</li> <li>There was a lot to do during the course which required more working hours   than expected, even though it probably on individual level was up   to the student to decide when the assignments were \"good enough\",   but maybe clarify what is really necessary for the course purpose   in contrast to individual development and individual choices.</li> <li>In general, I really loved to course,   so this is only small details and a personal feeling!   I felt like it was quite a lot of submissions...   but I was also attempting to make a whole poster and   there was not enough time for that...   I think it would have been less stressful to submit maybe   only a rough outline of a poster or graphical abstract   and then focus on one or two illustrations and make those really nice   using all the 3D and shading and colouring tools we learned...   For the feedback I had a hard time understanding the difference between   first and second feedback person and I think it would be fine   to just let the first person say whatever comes to mind   and the second one adding if they have any further comment...</li> <li>I feel like the use of adobe/ inkscape could have been better explained.   The slides that I used were interactive and were good,   but i had to look at further youtube videos on it as well.   I liked that there was a variety of choice of software   at varying price points, but considering i was just starting,   I used the free choice.   That was perhaps a bit more limiting in my ability to create something,   though I'm not sure as I did not try the others.   The last thing I would say is perhaps to put in some examples   of work that is not so refined and submitted to journals and magazines -   something that might be a bit more achievable for PhD/ post doc work.   Most of what we saw was of such high quality that i was inspired by it,   but had no idea how to achieve that.</li> <li>more examples of good scientific illustrations of the most common   plots -&gt; a good bar graph, regression analysis, correlation matrix,   heat map, forest plot etc.</li> <li>Maybe include one session in person for the people that are in Stockholm   or that can attend. It would be great to have the last session be   in person and receive feedback from the others.</li> <li>I guess the feedback should also be in written format from peers too.

Do you have any recommendations as to how the course could be improved?","text":"<p>Here I keep all feedback relevant to R:</p> <ul> <li>I think the way that the course is structured in the data viz part   is a bit messy, meaning that we were required to start working   on the code but with only few functions explained and   how the language actually works.   This led to some confusion and to rely on other tools   to make the code work.   It could be better to first give more background on how R functions   and then make the students work on the coding.</li> </ul> <p>I am unsure if this applies to my session. Assuming it applies to my session, then I can imagine that a learner want to learn the details of a language first before doing something useful with it. The book I used follows the idea that it is most useful to start with doing useful work.</p> <p>I am unsure about the 'other tools to make the code work'.</p> <p>Even though I understand the learner's preconception about what learning a programming language is all about, I should help alleviate this in my lesson</p> <ul> <li> <p>[ ] Discuss philosophy of the book</p> </li> <li> <p>[...]   The sections on R were not so well organized in my opinion.   It seemed that the two different teachers for R did not talk to each other   so some things were redundant - and some things that were explained   later really should've come first.   Especially regarding R there was a huge range of experiences   within the group and I feel like most people were left out;   either because it was too easy or because it was too complicated.   [...]</p> </li> </ul> <p>It is true the two teachers never spoke (I was ill, so the other had to hop in on short notice). I infer the other teacher has the idea that learning how to program is about learning the details of the language, which is dissonant with the book I used.</p> <p>I agree the group still had a wide range of experience. That is why we made the session optional.</p> <ul> <li>I would suggest adjusting the order of the R lectures.   It felt like some of the more advanced material   came before the basics were properly introduced,   which made it a bit hard to follow for some people.   I think starting with the foundational concepts earlier   would make the progression smoother and more accessible for everyone.</li> </ul> <p>I inferred earlier the other teacher has the idea that learning how to program is about learning the details of the language, which is dissonant with the book I used. Here I infer that this learner has the preconception that learning a programming language is about learning data types.</p> <p>I could go into more basic R, but I agree with the book's idea more: let's start with doing useful work!</p> <ul> <li>I didn't enjoy group work in R. I think that when it comes to coding,   individual work is the way to go. When it\u2019s such diverse group there   is always someone knowing a lot and someone knowing nothing and   it ends up with one person coding and the rest not knowing what to do.   I had similar sessions several times and it always ends like that,   which means that most people learn nothing during it.   But it was just one exercise, so no biggie.</li> </ul> <p>I understand the perspective. And reading my reflection on the group, there were indeed enough beginners. I assume that this person was not a beginner and -indeed- helped out all beginners instead. I have seen group work work better in other courses, so there this person and I have different experiences. I do think I should try out groups of 1 next time</p> <ul> <li> <p>[ ] Try our breakout rooms of 1 person</p> </li> <li> <p>Maybe the course could be divided in two:   one for complete beginners, and one for users with some experience.   Beginners could benefit from having more dedicated time to learn   to use the software, and experienced users could focus on more advanced   exercises and tools.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Interesting, as that was the idea me and Meike had: by making it optional, the experienced R programmers would not be in this session anymore. But I do remember that I should spend more time explaining RStudio. Let's do so next time</p> <ul> <li> <p>[ ] Spend time showing RStudio</p> </li> <li> <p>[...] The one major thing that can be improved is to find a way   to help complete beginners in more active way to avoid   them having the anxiety out not understanding something and   feeling the pressure because others are ahead with the task.   Otherwise, they end up feeling left behind.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Me and the learners are on the same team here. As I try out breakout rooms of 1 next time, maybe that will solve this problem too.</p> <ul> <li>Sessions regarding the use of R could be more wisely organized.   [...]   Also during Richel's sessions there was quite limited time to work   through the exercises if you had not worked with R before.   Maybe a similar tutorial session with self-study component   that was now done with Illustrator could work better also with R.</li> </ul> <p>As I try out breakout rooms of 1 next time, maybe that will solve this problem too.</p> <ul> <li>Martin Jonsson had a accessible presentation about R,   but fluency and structure could be improved   (seemed confused with some examples).   How do we use ggplot in concert with vector software to make a clear figure?</li> </ul> <p>Not about me. Note that he was called in with short notice, so maybe this was something that could not have been prevented.</p> <ul> <li>I can recommend some clarity in the syllabus,   there is no mention there about R,   however it still was a dominant part of the course.   Based on the syllabus my expectations were a course   predominant on the usage illustration software and   not an introduction to using R and plotting with R.</li> </ul> <p>I think this is an important point: it is an illustration course and not an R course. I maybe even agree that R was too dominant here. This is something for Meike to decide: to keep or remove R.</p> <ul> <li> <p>[ ] Suggest to Meike to remove R from the course</p> </li> <li> <p>I think the r coding parts were the weakest part of the course.   I luckily had prior knowledge of R, so for me it was good to follow.   However, the coding that was shown was usually very fast   without explaining every step.   I can imagine this is not optimal for new learners.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I see point.
