## 2025-10-03

I only have today to prepare. I am ill: I have back pain that hurts. It
hurts least when I stand, so I will do that. With some painkillers, I will
pull through as usual. But it does hinder my clarity of thought. Let's
see how well I do.

### Reflection from previous time

- [x] Make R session optional. I should put this in the course material.
  Done!

Done!
