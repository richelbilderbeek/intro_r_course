# Plotting

!!!- info "Learning outcomes"

    - Comfortable with the first chapter of
      [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
    - Can use `ggplot2` for simple plots
    - Can create simple ggplots from tidy data
    - Can use some ggplot aesthetics
    - Can use some ggplot geometrical objects

???- question "For teachers"

    Teaching goals are:

    - Learners have read part of the first chapter of
      [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
    - Learners have created simple plots in `ggplot2`
    - Learners can create simple ggplots from tidy data
    - Learners can set the aesthetics `x`, `y` and `color`
    - Learners can use `geom_scatter`, `geom_boxplot` and `geom_smooth`
      for simple aesthetics

    Prior question:

    - What is the most used use R package for plotting?
    - What is `gg` in `ggplot2`?
    - What is tidy data?
    - There is a philosophy that 'missing values should
      never silently go missing'. What does that mean?

    Feedback questions:

    - What is `gg` in `ggplot2`?
    - What is tidy data?
    - What is an aesthetic?
    - What is a `geom`?
    - The philosophy that 'missing values should
      never silently go missing'. What does this mean?

## Why `ggplot2` is important

![The `ggplot2` logo](../logo/ggplot2_logo_5.png)

`ggplot2` allows you to create publication-quality graphs for your paper,
using a unified (and extensible) grammar,
which allows you to express your unique
plotting needs.
