# 2025-04-04 Questions

- I will experiment with Mike Bell's teaching cycle
  (Prior, Present, Challenge, Feedback, Repeat),
  where I want to do 'Feedback' better: I will try to do this
  5-10 minutes at the end of each session, and I have questions
  prepared (at the 'For teachers' section at the top of each session).
  How do you think this worked out? Did I do it? If not, would you
  agree with my reasoning?
- (optional) I have a bad sense of how long each step of
  Mike Bell's teaching cycle (Prior, Present, Challenge, Feedback)
  takes me: I worry I talk too much.
  If you could keep track of how long each phase takes?
