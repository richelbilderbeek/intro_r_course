## Exercises

### Exercise 1

- Read [R for data science, chapter 2](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-basics.html)
  until the exercises of 2.5.
- Do these exercises

???- question "Answers"

    [See the answers here](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/r4ds-solutions/workflow-basics.html#exercises).

    Note that the answers use chapter 3.5.


### Exercise 2

- Install the `swirl` R package

???- question "Answer"

    ```r
    install.packages("swirl")
    ```

- Load the `swirl package

???- question "Answer"

    ```r
    library(swirl)
    ```

    This will show:

    ```r
    | Hi! Type swirl() when you are ready to begin.
    ```

- Start the `swirl package. Tip: you've gotten
  a hint in the previous step

???- question "Answer"

    ```r
    swirl()
    ```

- Give your name
- Pick the `R Programming` course
- Pick the `1: Basic Building Blocks` lesson
- Do at least 1 exercise, so you know how `swirl` behaves:
  the goal is to know whether to recommend/use `swirl`.
  Do as much exercises of this lesson as you think is useful to you
