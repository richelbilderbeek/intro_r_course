# Evaluations

???- question "Where can I evaluate this course?"

    Go to [evaluation](../evaluation.md) (singular) :-)

Here are the evaluation results of this course:

No |Date      |Evaluations                     |Success score
---|----------|--------------------------------|-------------
1  |2025-04-04|[Evaluation](20250404/README.md)|80%
2  |2025-10-03|[Evaluation](20251003/README.md)|.

- The 'Success score' is the average confidence the learners
  have on each of the learning outcomes of the course
