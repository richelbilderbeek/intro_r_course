## [Feedback](feedback.csv)

- This was a little fast-paced, even for a user with some experience with R.
  Very helpfull though! Plenty to take with me and go from here.
- I think the course was a bit too packed - although I have experience in
  coding (in Python) using a ""new"" language takes some time
  so it was difficult to get through all the exercises
- Thanks so much for a fun and informative lecture.
  As a self-learner I really appreciated all the resources
  you have shared with us!
  Also, I loved your positive attitude and high energy :)
- Maybe it would be better to explain how to read the code before
  actually using the program, but overall it was a formative and fun experience
- It has been fun learning about R although,
  I feel I still need to make time to learn and understand it
  since I am a complete beginner. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed the session.
