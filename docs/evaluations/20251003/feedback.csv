"This was a little fast-paced, even for a user with some experience with R. Very helpful though! Plenty to take with me and go from here."
"I think the course was a bit too packed - although I have experience in coding (in Python) using a ""new"" language takes some time so it was difficult to get through all the exercises"
"Thanks so much for a fun and informative lecture. As a self-learner I really appreciated all the resources you have shared with us! Also, I loved your positive attitude and high energy :)"
"Maybe it would be better to explain how to read the code before actually using the program, but overall it was a formative and fun experience"
"It has been fun learning about R although, I feel I still need to make time to learn and understand it since I am a complete beginner. Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed the session."
