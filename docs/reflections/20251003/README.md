I was ill this day. I think the teaching went well, but due to
pain I did not enjoy it as much as I usually do.

The group was markedly slower than the previous one.
This may be explained by this session being optional:
it seems most experienced R users have skipped it, except for one.

Due to the group being slower, I could not even discuss the most basic
of things. Due to this, the end was rushed :-/

## Evaluation results

The feedback is clear: the pace was too high. Without the experts around,
go slower next time

- [ ] Go slower next time

Even though I felt bad, enough learners remarked my energy. I am
happy to see that it does not show.

## Conclusion

I would give my teaching a 6.5 out of 10, as I did not slow down enough.
