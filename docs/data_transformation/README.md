    Prior question:

    - Which verbs do you associate with working with data?
    - What is tidy data?
    - What is a pipe?
    - When to use a pipe?
    - What is the different between `=` and `==`?

    Feedback questions:

## Why data transformations are important

![The dplyr logo](../logo/dplyr_logo_50.png)

Whenever you have your raw data, this is rarely shown in a paper as-is.
Instead, you will probably show only certain columns, or certain subsets,
give average over categories, etc. All these things are
called 'data transformations'.

## Why reading a file is important

Whenever you have your raw data, you have it in one or more files.
To do data transformations, you will first need to read it.
