# Frequently Asked Questions

## When to follow the course

### When should I follow this course?

When you want to get started with R.

Especially at the start of any new programming language,
having help is very useful: some error messages seem
like complex, yet have simple solutions. A teacher
helps you get past those first errors.

### When should I consider to **not** follow this course?

These are the reasons to consider to **not** follow this course:

#### Reason 1: you want to learn advanced things

When you have written your first scripts in R and
expect to learn new and more advanced things.

In this case, the course will go too slow for you.

However, you will probably be put to work by the teachers
to help out other learners.
If you like to test your own knowledge by teaching others,
you will likely thrive in the course.

#### Reason 2: you have social anxiety

When you have social anxiety.

In this case, the course will be too social for you.

However, in this course, it is perfectly OK to give a wrong
answer or to say 'I do not know'. This is what a former
learner had to say on this:

You are welcome to try and leave anytime you want.
The course material is made for self-study too, with videos
for all exercises.
Do fill in [the evaluation](evaluation.md)
when you leave early :-)

## Prerequisites

### What are the prerequisites for following this course?

See [prerequisites](prerequisites.md).

### How can I check if I have registered?

[Contact the course coordinator](contact_us.md).

### How can I check if I have a good Zoom setup?

- You are in a room where you can talk
- You talk into a (standalone or headset) microphone
- Others can clearly hear you when you talk
- Others can see you
- You can hear others clearly when they talk

### How can I get a good Zoom setup?

- Find/schedule/book a room where you can talk
- Buy a simple headset

### What if I don't have a good Zoom setup? Is that OK?

No.

You will feel left out, as the course in highly interactive.
It would be weird to the other learners.

## Teaching

### Why is the course learner-centered?

Because that is good teaching.

This course defines good teaching as 'evidence-based
methods to let learners acquire new skills and the monitoring
of this acquisition'. This means that it should be observed
that learners need more/less to time to practice and following
the schedule based on that. Learner-centered teaching has
an effect size from 0.36 `[Hattie ranking]`
or 0.64/0.70 `[Cornelius-White, 2007][Hattie, 2012]`.

Or: it is useless to go faster than the learners can follow.
Lecturing is known to negatively affect learning `[Hattie, 2023]`.

The teaching methods of this course follow the
evidence-based teaching cycle by `[Bell, 2020a]`,
which allows learner-centered teaching.

## Website

### Why don't you just publish the Zoom room on the website?

As this course follow [Zoom's recommended practices](https://www.zoom.com/en/products/virtual-meetings/resources/securing-your-meetings/).

## Other

### What if I have another question?

Preferably:

- Add an issue at [https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/intro_r_course](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/intro_r_course).
  This requires a GitHub account and ensures your question is shown publicly
  to all of the course's teaching team

Else:

- [Contact us by email](contact_us.md)
